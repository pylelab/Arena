# Arena (Atomic Reconstruction of RNA)

Arena is a stand-alone program used for the full-atomic reconstruction of RNA structures from coarse-grained models. Arena can build in full-atomic detail for any residues with at least one heavy atom (of any identity). Arena takes an input in PDB format and first fills in the missing heavy atoms via a superimposition algorithm. Arena iterates through three refinement stages to correct bond lengths and angles, correct base and base pair conformations, and remove atomic clashes. Structures generated by Arena are highly accurate in terms of RMSD (< 3.7 Å on average), contain almost no clashes, and run in < 3.5 sec on average. The runtime will depend on the length of your RNA; the longest RNA we tested was 692 nt and ran in < 35 sec. Arena requires no additional installations and can simply be downloaded from here and run on your local computer. We have provided two example PDB structures to run with Arena, as well as code to calculcate the RMSD and number of clashes.

## Installation

Download Arena from GitHub into your desired location, such as your Desktop:
```
git clone https://github.com/pylelab/Arena.git
```

In the new Arena folder, compile with Clang:
```
cd Arena
make Arena
```

## Usage

Run Arena using one of the provided examples:
```
./Arena Examples/5osg2.input.pdb Examples/5osg2.output.pdb 5
```

To see the help menu:
```
./Arena
```

## Special Case: Multiple Models

```
python split_models.py Examples/2koc.pdb
```

## Benchmarking Scripts

Calculate RMSD:
```
python calculate_RMSD.py -r Examples/5osg2.pdb -i Examples/5osg2.output.pdb
```

Calculate number of clashes:
```
make Arena_counter
./Arena_counter Examples/5osg2.output.pdb Examples/5osg2.clashes.txt 5
```
